# CSLR
This repo holds codes of the paper: Continuous Sign Language Recognition via Temporal Super-Resolution Network. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00928.pdf)

### Notice

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (1.11.0+cu113). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)ï¼Œfor beam search decode.

- This project runs in pycharm, so you need to install pycharm

- The SLR is the main function.

### Data Preparation

1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX/).

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it.

### Inference

We provide the pretrained models (Down-sampling factor 1) for inference,
But the result that the models (downsampling factor 4) needs to be retrained:
|  Backbone  |  Down-sampling factor 1  |  Down-sampling factor 4  |
|            | WER on Dev | WER on Test | WER on Dev | WER on Test |
|  --------  | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| CNN+BiLstm | 26.1%      | 26.7%       | 29.8%      | 30.4%       |
|     VAC    | 21.8%      | 22.8%       | 25.1%      | 26.2%       |
|   MSTNet   | 20.3%      | 21.4%       | 23.4%      | 24.7%       |
